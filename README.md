# Incorrect Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values.

The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers. However, it incorrectly returns 0 when either input is null, instead of throwing an error or handling nulls gracefully.

The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle null values, ensuring the function behaves as expected.
